       " \"Love this place. \\xa0Great coffee, wine and snacks. \\xa0Even better than the food and libations is the ambiance. \\xa0However, I wouldn't recommend arriving within 1.5 - 2 hours prior to closing. \\xa0They decided to close up while there were still 7 patrons still sitting around. \\xa0<br><br>I've worked in the industry before, so it's not that big of a deal to get a head start on closing. \\xa0But, when it's a beautiful day outside, 7 patrons inside, 10 outside, and more coming through the door, it's not a good idea to vacuum and pull away outside decor early. \\xa0Convenient for the employee to leave earlier, but inconvenient to the customers. \\xa0Just my $0.02. \\xa0<br><br>I'll still return, however probably won't be visiting in the afternoon again because of this.\",\n",
       " 'I loved finding this coffee shop while on vacation. As an east coast transplant who popped awake at 4 am Pacific, it became an oasis. The breakfast quiches are exceptional. Staff is very friendly, and the coffee is.... [kisses fingertips and hums solemnly]. If I lived in the area, this would be a daily stop.',\n",
       " \"Armistice is one of my fav Seattle businesses. Rebecca and her staff are warm, welcoming, fun + professional. The space is absolutely stunning, and the delicious coffee is roasted in-house. I love to work/read on the patio when it's nice out, or indoors on the leather couch. A lot of regulars come \\xa0to Armistice and it's so fun seeing friendly, familiar faces. <br>They have all alternative milks if you do non-dairy and the croissants are delicious. <br>I cannot recommend this business enough. Home away from home\",\n",
       " 'Excellent lattes- love that they have oat milk as an option. I have gone a few times now. Got the almond pastry once and it was just okay.',\n",
       " \"This place has ample indoor seating and is a great option for folks trying to get some work done. I've been here only a couple of times but absolutely loved the vibe and service. My personal favorites include the Chai and Mocha [which had a nearly perfect blend of expresso, chocolate and sugar]. Surely a great addition to East Lake's glowing list of cafes\",\n",
       " \"First and foremost... the espresso here is amazing... Fresh. \\xa0 The crema is perfect. \\xa0 The beans are created with love daily! \\xa0This is definitely my favorite coffee spot. I love hanging out here it reminds me of my trips to Europe. The owner Rebecca is fantastic too... I was having problems with my burr grinder and she even fix my grinder!!!!! \\xa0Above and beyond the call for espresso. <br><br>I am so happy they opened up on eastlake... it's made such a difference in this neighborhood!\",\n",
       " 'This is such a great spot! My cappuccino was excellent and the guys working there were super friendly. I also got a blueberry scone which was great and they had lots of other goodies I want to try. The space/decor is impeccable and perfect for working - wish I lived closer so this could be my regular coffee shop!',\n",
       " 'They make you follow them on Facebook for WiFi, outdoor area is nice but no outlets, not the friendliest of service. Moved inside and the tables in the back do not balance and are significantly lower than would be preferred when working on a laptop (I\\'m only 5\\'6\"). Coffee is pretty decent but is overpriced to other quality shops.',\n",
       " \"Cool environment. Especially if people like the cozier vibe while also having natural light and the ability for fresh air. Lots of variety for seating: long table, comfy chairs, couches, smaller tables and indoor/outdoor options. They have a good selection for drinks and make some of their syrups in house. I ordered an americano and it was good -- by no means the best coffee I've had in Seattle but I enjoyed the environment.\",\n",
       " \"Armistice is such a little Seattle gem. The owner is always around which gives the place a homey, family feel that a lot of coffee shops around here lack. Not to mention, their other staff are kind and engaging too which rocks. It feels like they like working there. If you're looking for a low-key place to meet a friend and catch up, or to hunker down with your dog/laptop, this place is pretty perfect. Plus, their coffee is AMAZING and roasted in house and they have super nummy oat milk for those of us who need milk alternatives.\",\n",
       " 'How should I put this... <br><br>Setting: <br><br>Good seating arrangements with leather sofas on the inside.<br>Quaint small outdoor seating/patio<br>Friendly staff, but a line can form that goes out - this is due to the cash register being close to the entrance.<br><br>Coffee: <br>Choices are good and they have \"\"Cortados\".<br>Those that like or need to have alternative milks - they have: Soy, and Oat milk.<br><br>Food: <br>Scones, quiches and other pastries.<br><br>Quality: Overall, great quality - the Quiches I had was well textured with Goad Cheese and well baked crust with asparagus cuts inside. The Cortado, was a bit on the stronger side. However, very smooth and good beans!<br><br>Recommendation: If you live around here or come early. It is a great place to relax. If you are needing to study, work on your laptop for a project or God time. It is not very noisy and Zenful on the outdoor seating area. However, like almost everywhere in Seattle. You will have to find street parking (free curb parking).',\n",
       " 'If you like espresso drinks or coffee drinks with milk, this may be a spot for you. For someone who prefers drip coffee it is just ok. The only option is their house blend, which is perfectly acceptable. It would have been nice if there were single origin options. I like that there are a few different cup sizes. Prices are reasonable-ish since coffee is served on drip instead of pour over.<br><br>The interior decor is nice. I like the glass wall panels they have. <br><br>In the grand scheme of things and when compared to other specialty coffee cafes, I think Armistice is more of a 3.5.',\n",
       " 'Cool ambiance and friendly staff. Prices are pretty equivocal with other Seattle coffee shops. It was actually quite quiet there so I imagine this could be a great place to study.']"
